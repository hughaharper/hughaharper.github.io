title:  "IGPP Computing short course"

There used to be a course called Intro to Computing at IGPP that geophysics students could take during their first year. The goals of the course were to teach incoming students, from a variety of backgrounds, some basic but essential computing skills for classes and research at IGPP. The course hasn't been offered for a few years, but we're planning to "reboot" it in the form of a short course a couple weeks before the fall quarter begins. 

I've basically kept the structure of P. Shearer's class notes with a few updates/changes (e.g.; bash -> zsh, FORTRAN -> Python and C) and additional topics (notably git and high performance computing). I'll host all the course materials on this domain. Here's a tentative topic list:

- Unix
- GMT
- Latex
- Git
- High Performance Computing
- Programming Languages
    - Python
    - C
