This site is pretty bare right now, but I'm working on making it something useful!

I hope this site can act as a base for relevant datasets, programs/jupyter notebooks, and updates related to my research. I also have a few short guides I plan to share that I think will be useful to graduate students in geophysics, but particularly to graduate students at IGPP. These are mostly software tips, configurations, workflows... things I wish I had known earlier.
