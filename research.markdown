# Research Interests
## Marine gravity recovery from satellite altimetry
This research is part of the ongoing work pioneered by David Sandwell and Walter Smith (e.g., papers).

## Marine tectonics
Lots of stuff revealed by gravity... Currently, I'm interested in features we call "seesaw propagating ridges" or SSPs.

## Global bathymetry
Former postdoc in the Sandwell lab, Brook Tozer, worked to make a new set of global topography/bathymetry. Currently, I'm working to add more multibeam data to the database. I'm experimenting with better ways to "clean" multibeam datasets of this size.

# Older projects
## The 2002 Mw7.9 Denali, AK earthquake
At the University of Alaska Fairbanks, I worked under the guidance of Prof. Jeff Freymueller (now at Michigan State University). I developed coseismic models of the 2002 Denali fault earthquake, the postseismic deformation.


## 3D mechanical modeling of fault slip rates in the Los Angeles basin
As an undergraduate, I worked with Prof. Scott Marshall at Appalachian State University.
