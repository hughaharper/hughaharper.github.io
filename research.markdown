## Marine gravity recovery from satellite altimetry
Prediction of marine gravity from satellite altimeter data is a process that emerged with the Seasat mission in the late 1970s.

In the Topex lab, I help to process incoming data from active satellite altimeters which we compile to re-estimate the global gravity and vertical gravity gradient (VGG) grids. The most recent publication can be found here.

## Marine tectonics
The recovered gravity anomalies and VGG over the oceans reveal details of and provide context to ocean floor features that may be previously unexplored.

In early 2021, we published [*Marine vertical gravity gradients reveal the global distribution and tectonic significance of "seesaw" ridge propagation*](files/Harper_et_al-2021.pdf) in JGR: Solid Earth.

## Global bathymetry
In the past, the Topex lab has produced global topography/bathymetry grids which combine shipboard echosounder measurements with predictions from satellite altimetry (e.g., Tozer et al., 2019; Becker et al., 2014). Currently, we're working to improve these products in a few different ways.

* Editing multibeam data with machine learning models

* Synthetic high resolution bathymetry

# Older projects
## The 2002 Mw7.9 Denali, AK earthquake
At the University of Alaska Fairbanks, I worked with Prof. Jeff Freymueller (now at Michigan State University). I developed coseismic and postseismic models of the 2002 Denali fault earthquake.

We haven't gotten around to publishing this research, but [here](files/temp.txt) is my Master's thesis.


## 3D mechanical modeling of fault slip rates in the Los Angeles basin
As an undergraduate, I worked with [Prof. Scott Marshall](https://www.appstate.edu/~marshallst/) at Appalachian State University. We haven't published any research, but [here](files/temp.txt) is my undergraduate thesis.
